# film-imdb-parse

This repo stores JSON files for over a thousand IMDB pages. These are mostly films that have been nominated for a major oscar award (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor/Actress) or are in the IMDB top 250.

There are programs to upload the JSON files into sqlite etc.
I will put up query programs soon.
